# Welcome to Harris County Vaccine Hub!

## Set Up
1. Go to the vaccine-backend file and follow instructions.
2. Once you've done that and have the backend up and running, type `npm install` in the terminal and hit enter.
3. Do the same with `npm start`. You will be prompted to run the app on another port because 3000 is full. Type `Y` for yes.

## About the App
This is my Flatiron School capstone project, a culmination of 15 weeks of learning. This application has a Ruby on Rails backend with a JavaScript frontend, using React as a framework. Styling was done with a combination of Material UI and CSS. 

## Advanced Tech Used:
1. Map: MapBox API
2. Authorization: JWT and bcrypt 
3. Datepicker: @material-ui/pickers
4. Date Utility Library: date-fns
