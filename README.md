# Welcome to Harris County Vaccine Hub!
>This is my Flatiron School capstone project, a culmination of 15 weeks of learning. Inspired by my own frustration with registering for the COVID-19 vaccination, I decided to create an application that would be a one stop shop for residents of the Houston area to register for vaccine appointments. This project uses Ruby on Rails on the back-end and JavaScript and React on the front-end, as well as Material-UI for styling, JWT for authentication, and the MapBox API for generating a custom map.  

## Technologies
* Map: MapBox API
* Authorization: JWT and bcrypt 
* Datepicker: @material-ui/pickers
* Date Utility Library: date-fns

## Demo
* Video Demo: https://youtu.be/hhK7M_CAPAU
* Heroku Deployment: https://vaccine-hub.herokuapp.com/

## Set Up
* Go to https://github.com/thequeenbeebs/vaccine-backend and follow instructions.
* Once you've done that and have the backend up and running, type `npm install` in the terminal and hit enter.
* Do the same with `npm start`. You will be prompted to run the app on another port because 3000 is full. Type `Y` for yes.

## Continuing Goals
* Work on ADA Accessibility
* Update MapBox API to use ReactMapGL for cleaner functionality
* Add a waitlist for vaccination centers
* Testing
* Emails with appointment confirmation
